# 5G-NR
hey there ! this my understanding of 5G NR technology.
### WIRELESS COMMUNICATION: 
Wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium.
wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space.
*a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components*;**A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.**
**TRANSMITTER**- The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter.
**RECEIVER** - The entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver.
-our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals.
**WIRELESS SIGNALS-**  Wireless signals are also called Radio-frequency signals.
All wireless or radio signals are quite similar in nature to sunlight or visible light, at such all wireless signals travel at the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second.
Two basic attributes of radio frequency signals --->  frequency and wavelength
_Frequency :_ Frequency is the number of repetitions that the periodic electromagnetic signal undergoes in a given second, and the frequency is measured in the unit of hertz. 
_WAVELENGTH :_ Wavelength is the distance that periodic wireless signal travels during one cycle or one periodicity, and because it is a measure of distance, it is mostly measured in meters or millimeters.
+  wireless signals are interchangeably also called radio signals or radio frequency or RF signals because the frequency of those wireless signals happens to lie between the range specified by the traditional radio frequency range.
_HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE OVER A NETWORK :_
+  These periodic RF signals or wireless signals are also known as **carrier waves** because they carry the information from one end to the other.
+   RF signals are used as the so-called vehicle for information transfer because they carry your information from the transmitter to the receiver.
+  **Modulation** - is a process by which we impress or impose information onto the carrier wave for transmission.
+  Modulation at the high level is about carefully changing some of the specific attributes of the radio-frequency signal.
+  At the receiver, however, the other end of wireless communication, we need to extract that information from the incoming carrier wave.
+ **DEMODULATION :** Demodulation is the process of recovering the data that has been impressed upon the carrier wave by the transmitter.
+ *MODEM* stands for modulation and demodulation and is the device used for the same .

**WIRELESS CHANNEL-** The imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel.
