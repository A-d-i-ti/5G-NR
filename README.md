# 5G-NR
hey there ! this my understanding of 5G NR technology.
### WIRELESS COMMUNICATION: 
Wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium.
wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space.
*a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components*;**A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.**
+ **TRANSMITTER**- The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter.
+ **RECEIVER** - The entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver.
- our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals.
+ **WIRELESS SIGNALS-**  Wireless signals are also called Radio-frequency signals.
- All wireless or radio signals are quite similar in nature to sunlight or visible light, at such all wireless signals travel at the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second.
- Two basic attributes of radio frequency signals --->  frequency and wavelength
+ _Frequency :_ Frequency is the number of repetitions that the periodic electromagnetic signal undergoes in a given second, and the frequency is measured in the unit of hertz. 
+ _WAVELENGTH :_ Wavelength is the distance that periodic wireless signal travels during one cycle or one periodicity, and because it is a measure of distance, it is mostly measured in meters or millimeters.
+  wireless signals are interchangeably also called radio signals or radio frequency or RF signals because the frequency of those wireless signals happens to lie between the range specified by the traditional radio frequency range.
+ _HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE OVER A NETWORK :_
+  These periodic RF signals or wireless signals are also known as **carrier waves** because they carry the information from one end to the other.
+   RF signals are used as the so-called vehicle for information transfer because they carry your information from the transmitter to the receiver.
+  **Modulation** - is a process by which we impress or impose information onto the carrier wave for transmission.
+  Modulation at the high level is about carefully changing some of the specific attributes of the radio-frequency signal.
+  At the receiver, however, the other end of wireless communication, we need to extract that information from the incoming carrier wave.
+ **DEMODULATION :** Demodulation is the process of recovering the data that has been impressed upon the carrier wave by the transmitter.
+ *MODEM* stands for modulation and demodulation and is the device used for the same .
+ _HERE IS A SIMPLE TELEPHONIC CONVERSATATION FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING : REFER THE IMAGE BELOW_
+ ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/ccd9c8eb-ff6f-4aee-9507-64086d884847)
**WIRELESS CHANNEL-** The imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel.
- Radio frequency signal travels over the air and when it travels over the air it faces certain **impediments**. The most important and most significant of which is called attenuation or part loss or **transmission loss**.
- **Transmission loss**- The wireless signal has to spend some energy when going from one point to another.The manifestation of that loss of energy is quantified in technical terms as part loss or transmission loss.
- SIGNAL FROM OUR PHONE ----> CELL TOWER -----> RECEIVER'S PHONE
- The transmission loss or path loss is a roughly proportional operational frequency.
- Higher the frequency of operation, higher the corresponding path loss will be.
- IN SIMPLE WORDS -_Higher the frequency of the radio signal higher the pathloss that it encounters when going from one point to another._
- **Impediments that affect a wireless signal** -noise and interference
- **NOISE -** Noise is unwanted energy that is not deliberate in nature.
- In that the wireless noise or the electromagnetic noise is always present in most devices and most communication links. In fact, some of the noise can be one generated within the communication device itself, also known as **thermal noise**.
- The ambient noise which is always present and cannot be minimized beneath a certain threshold .
- **INTERFERENCE -** when two nearby transmitters and nearby is the key, when they use the same radio frequency at the same time, they create interference.
- Interference is deliberate in nature and can be mitigated by careful planning of the frequency use by different entities in the network.
- Noise and Interference have a tendency to **Change some of the fundamental attributes** of the electromagnetic carrier wave so that it becomes little difficult for the intended receiver to demodulate and extract the intended information from the signal that has slightly been changed in form because of noise and interference.

-  Noise and interference have a tendency to reduce the quality of the signal that is ultimately received .
- SNR - SIGNAL NOISE RATIO gives us an mathematical estimation of the noise present .
- SINR - SIGNAL INTERFERENCE NOICE RATIO gives us an mathematical estimation of interference as well as noise present .

### RADIO SPECTRUM : 
Radio spectrum essentially is just the range of radio frequencies over which a wireless communication takes place, for a specific purpose.
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/564d6641-55f0-47d9-9e75-8d4b27c861f3)
- **There are some regulatory entity whose job it is to carefully assign dedicated slices of radio spectrum to different services.**
- In case of United States, that government regulatory entity is the **FCC or Federal Communications Commission**
- _It is the local regulatory authority that determines what spectrum will be used by what service, for what purpose._
-  **channel bandwidth / frequency channel**- limited range of frequencies over which a wireless device, exchanges wireless or radio signals, it's called its frequency channel.frequency channel currently being used by a wireless device, it's called the channel bandwidth.
-  ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/1d15cec6-15fe-47a0-b5c1-65ccfee5991c)
- _**what prevents every channel from being a wideband channel? **_
-  **Availability** is the primary reason why every channel can't be wideband. frequency spectrum is limited by definition
- **COST** Being extremely expensive because spectrum is inherently a scarce and expensive commodity
-  #### MULTIPLE ACCESS OF RADIO CHANNEL : 
-  There are defined algorithms that allow sharing of the radio channel and that translates to a concept of multiple access. multiple access allows us to achieve that desirable trade off between the cost of the frequency spectrum you need to operate your system. multiple access involves carefully leveraging some of the attributes of the wireless channel.
- Two ways to share the limited and expensive spectrum -**Frequency division duplexing [FDD]and Time division duplexing [TDD]**
- **Frequency division duplexing ,FDD**- it stands for frequency division duplexing, entails and requires rather a pair of radio channels for simultaneous two-way communication. For example, if you have abundant frequency spectrum, you could allocate one channel on which your cell tower would transmit. You could allocate a different independent frequency channel on which your phone would transmit.  
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/d024d922-8108-4a8a-a270-13792f36200c)
- **Disadvantage of this FDD mechanism** is that you have to have enough budget in order to buy two separate frequency channels. Not only that, your local regulatory authorities have to have abundance spectrum available in order to allocate two independent channels for your system.One for downlink, one for uplink.
- **Time division duplexing ,TDD**-TDD system has access to only one frequency channel. There are no two frequency channels anymore. Both the base station and your phones have to operate on the same frequency channel.
- Single radio channel is the basic characteristic of a TDD system.
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/71abd90c-9b98-4342-a008-af9287f56d80)

#### CELLULAR CONCEPTS :
A mobile network's coverage area is divided into what are called cells, the small areas which are called cells.That is where the name cellular communication or cellular network derives from.
- Because the area is covered into many different cells of small size and each of those individual cells is served by what is known as a **Base station**.
- t is also known as the **cell tower or simply the tower**.
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/3be15b8d-aa84-4c0f-aeae-d71b78d44845)
-
-   WE have to maximize the data rate and coverage area while keeping the number of base stations at a minimum.
-   CELLULAR NETWORK :consists of -->RAN {RADIO ACCESS NETWORK},CORE NETWORK & SERVICES .
-  ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/2b410e1f-799a-4d6f-9d90-e3d589f5a553)
 
- **RADIO ACCESS NETWORK,RAN** : The RAN comprises multiple base stations or cell towers and these are the entities as we have seen that exchange wireless signals with your phone.
- **CORE NETWORK :**it is supposed to be the routing bridge between your phone and the services network .it acts as the middleman between your phone and the services network.

- **first generation of cellular communications, i.e 1G.**-  In the 1970s and '80s with what is retroactively now known as the *first generation of cellular communications, i.e 1G.** 
     The predominant use case at that time was to enable people to make and receive voice calls on the go wherever they were.
- In the first generation of cellular communications, our analog voice was imposed onto the outgoing carrier wave using analog modulation.
- **SECOND generation of cellular communications, i.e 2G.**- The fundamental focus was still on providing voice services but now you will see a different qualifier and that is for a 
   well-merited reason. But in the second generation of cellular communication, the modulation technique that would be used to super-impose our voice onto the outgoing carrier wave would be digital modulation.
- **THIRD generation of cellular communication, i.e 3G.**-gave us seamless access to mobile Internet for eg:news or weather forecast, or be it as specialized and complex as video broadcast, audio broadcast, or email.the speeds were somewhat limited compared to what we have today on the order of few 100 Kbps or a few Mbps.
- **FOUTH generation of cellular communication, i.e 4G, also known as LTE**-4G not only improved the speeds that it would offer to your mobile phones, but it also greatly expanded the Ecosystem beyond just everyday phones into the realm of tablets, smart home device, fitness trackers, etc. That was the fundamental power of 4G in that it expanded our ecosystem.
- **FIFTH generation of cellular technologies, i.e 5G.-** ultra high speeds and ultra high network capacity.will absolutely require low lag or low time delay so that they can offer real-time and interactive experience to their users, like VR or augmented reality.
- #### MORE ABOUT 5G :
-  5G also known as NR or new radio.5G NR is expected to provide us with unprecedented levels of capability and efficiency.
-  ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/52483fc1-fc5b-4ad8-b7ea-3763957d5fa1)

1.**eMBB -** **Enhanced mobile broadband**
- emphasis of eMBB clearly is on higher speeds and spectral efficiency because as we know, higher spectral efficiency contributes ultimately to higher speed.
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/14a5e6aa-ceac-4e0f-99ed-3731c312e2f9)
-  even if somebody is on a high-speed train that is moving at 100 or 200 miles an hour, they will expect high-speed broadband-like Internet to be available to them and eMBB is in a position to provide exactly that.
2.**MMTC Massive Machine Type Communications,**- known as _mIoT or massive IOT i.e INTERNET OF THINGS_
- mMTC is the umbrella that enables such electronic devices to communicate with the network and enter with each other.
- fundamental emphasis of mMTC is on power conservation and simplicity of protocols instead of spirit or spectral efficiency. 
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/34d19ebe-f202-424a-ac9f-e7150eb97793)
- 
- This particular service class is meant for devices or applications that are mostly unmanned.
- For example, our phones or tablets are devices that we closely interact with on a daily basis.
3. **URLLC ,Ultra reliable, Low latency Communications.**- 
-URLLC is an umbrella that encompasses all the applications and use cases that require a highly reliable but at the same time low latency communication link.
-FOR EXAMPLE ,Military, first responders, law enforcement for all of those use cases every second counts,
-![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/615227e0-4125-4882-a5c0-fc5144ac7f62)
- emphasis is on minimizing end to end latency instead of emphasizing higher speeds.
- ### SOME TERMINALOGY :
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/6a07e8d0-2ded-406f-bc91-c74e1167f762)
### DEPLOYMENT OF 5G NETWORK :
-We habe two options for deployment --> 1.STANDALONE  2.NON-STANDALONE 
- **STANDALONE,SA :** at one end you have a 5G phone which connects to a 5G gNodeB, which itself is a part of a wider 5G RAN, and the 5G RAN connects to a 5G core network also known as 5G C. So end-to-end, it is a 5G system. And because that end-to-end 5G system is capable of standing on its own, so to speak, that is the reason why this particular option of 5G network deployment is called a standalone option.
Not only are the costs related to hardware and software, but keep in mind that in order for the RAN to operate in 5G technology, you have to have some 5G spectrum associated with that RAN. And you have to buy or lease that additional 5G spectrum, which operators currently don't have at least._SO FOR THIS SITUATION WE HAVE NON-STANTALONE DEPLOYMENT ._
- **NON-STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT,NSA :** In a typical innocent network, operators can continue working with the existing 4G deployment. So operators who have 4G core network, which is called evolved packet core, will continue operating with that, and that 4G core network will connect with the nationwide deployment of 4G RAN.
- An NSA option allows you to have only a limited or surgical deployment of 5G gNodeBs in areas where you have severe capacity challenges which cannot be met by LTE.

- SOME ANALOGIES :
- ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/eab546ff-0bcc-42a5-98ee-0db5d870a561)
- **A flexible slot-based** framework, as the name suggest , is about making timelines a little flexible.
- frequency spectrum for those two seconds. Now, if the UE requires those two second. But what if the UE is faster than expected and it completes the task in just one second instead of two secondsAt least the resources corresponding to the remaining one second would be wasted because the UE has already completed its task. But that is where 5G makes all our operation more efficient in that not only does 5G allocate a given UE the precise amount of resources that will be needed to accomplish the task at hand.
- flexible slot-based framework is equivalent to flexible road framework, wherein lane markers can shift dynamically, and that ultimately allows us to efficiently adapt to all traffic types and situations within the existing amount of resources we have without using any additional resources.
- **OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing:** OFDM allows you to send data not on wideband channels, but rather on multiple narrowband channels.
- OFDM allows you to use precisely the amount of bandwidth that you require and you have available and that it makes the whole system modular.
- scalable OFDM based air interface relates to a hypothetical road design where you can construct lanes out of Legos so to speak and you can add or subtract lanes on a given road precisely, depending upon the requirements of the oncoming traffic.
- **CHANNEL CODING :** Channel coding at a high level is about taking your intended data that the transmitter has in mind and wrapping it up, so to speak, in additional metadata.
   -  That way, even if some of that data gets corrupted because of noise interference and pathloss, by looking at the metadata and the original data together, the receiver can make 
      some educated guess about what the original data might have been
- **MIMO :** MIMO stands for multiple input, multiple output.
  - Input in this context is the number of antennas on the transmitters and output in this context is the number of antennas on the receiver. So if both the transmitter and the receiver, multiple antennas, the multiple input multiple output, it is said to be a MIMO system.
  -  nothing says that you have to be limited on either transmitter or receiver with just one antenna. What if both the transmitter and the receiver had one more antenna that was working in parallel.
  -  So instead of sending just one wireless signal between two devices, you are now trying to send to different wireless signals between the same pair of devices.
  -  It will significantly improve your data rate or speed or to put. And that is the fundamental premise of MIMO or multiple input, multiple output.
  -  **if you send two different signals on the same channel at the same time, you will have interference ???**
  -  to over come this interference problem ..two signals won't interfere with each other is because they are encoded by the transmitter differently.
  - **Massive MIMO** in that by transmitting multiple wireless signals at the same time using the same frequency channel. MIMO significantly **increases network coverage and capacity** and soldiers massive MIMO.
  - ![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/17af55d5-48f1-453f-9458-54ff37ea69b9)
  - **Software-Defined Networking,SDN :**  is about making your network more software-oriented than they were before. In that are trying to implement as many functionalities in a software and not just that, trying to implement them in generic software that could be compatible between different vendors.
  - With software-defined networking at a high level, the same underlying infrastructure because it is more software-oriented can be abstracted for different applications and network services.
  -  Not only does it make your system more resilient in that backward compatibility and interoperability is less of a problem and because you can have many different application or software developers working on that generic networking software,
  -  you also can benefit from rapid innovation in the entire ecosystem on account of the programmability that is offered by making these networks software-oriented
  -  **Network Functions Virtualization,NFV :** It allows to host that specialized hardware or a server firm, which turns out to be in the real networks that is deployment or offload it onto a Cloud network.
  -  _networking functionalities implemented as generic and broadly compatible software, that generic software can run on top of generic or as they call it COGS, **commercial off-the-shelf**_
  - The big advantage of making it into a Cloud is that you have **instant scalability.**
  -![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/7604495e-bbe0-4dfb-9cfa-aaec13b188d6)

- Because this cloudification, so to speak, is completely transparent with the end devices, as long as you maintain the performance guarantees between the 5G network and your Cloud providers' network, you should be able to provide reliable end-to-end 5G service without hosting a coordinate work yourself because your coordinate work is now sitting somewhere in the Cloud. That is the fundamental Internet of network function virtualization.
- **EDGE COMPUTING :**
- Edge computing is an emerging computing paradigm which refers to a range of networks and devices at or near the user.
-![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/937401a0-ea85-4b4f-bea9-9a8a3cf97c35)

-Edge computing can easily facilitate services that require extremely strict bounds on latency, that require enhanced security, as well as additional bandwidth.
- **5G utilizes in order to improve the network performance features such as network slicing, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, and mobile Edge computing or MEC.**

### The 5G NR  :
- we have the proverbial low bands that are under 1 Gigahertz, also informally known as Sub-1 GHz. Some of the example bands in which 5G could be deployed here are bands like 600 MHz, 700, or 850 MHz.
- #### Millimeter wave mmWAVE :
- Millimeter wave simply is a certain range of frequencies where your signal **wavelength is on the order of a few millimeters**. That's why the name millimeter wave.
- there aren't any competing technologies in the millimeter wave spectrum, any technology that can successfully use the millimeter wave spectrum is going to have the proverbial first-mover advantage so to speak and it is going to have access to unprecedented amount of spectrum in other millimeter wave region.
- Millimeter wave is about improving your technological capabilities and prowess so that you are now able to utilize some of the frequency spectra that were earlier unused and because they are unused, you will have access to abundant bandwidth in those frequency ranges on the order of 400 or 800 megahertz at a time.
-  That enormous bandwidth directly translates to significantly higher individual user speeds and in aggregate manner, significantly higher network capacity.

### WHAT IS BEAMFORMING !!
-![image](https://github.com/A-d-i-ti/5G-NR/assets/142913419/23717158-0fa3-42f5-b0a5-e370df0ba1fe)

-Beamforming entails that those antenna elements will focus their transmitted energy as a sharp narrow beam focused only in other design direction of interest towards the user. Because there is this one sharp beam of energy, there is no wastage in lateral directions. So that is the fundamental premise of beamforming rather than sending your energy in all the directions wherein it may not be necessary, rather focus your energy as a sharp B only in the direction where it is necessary. If your user is located here, you will send your beam of energy precisely in this direction and not in the entire space. That is the fundamental premise of beamforming, a focusing transmitted signal only in the desired direction and thus leading to a narrow beam. This is something that we had also alluded to when discussing some of the fundamental benefits of millimeter-wave. We are going to not only talk more about beamforming and its advantages but we're also going to tie the two together as to what relationship millimeter-wave and a massive MIMO share. But for the time being, let's continue talking about the benefits of beamforming. Going back to this schematic, one of the fundamental benefits of beamforming can be explained as follows. Going back to Module 1, I hope you'll remember that we had talked about a specific metric of wireless systems, that is signal to noise ratio. This is your desired signal and denominator would be noise. We have also established that in order to improve the performance of a wireless system, it would help to maximize the signal to noise ratio, ie., for a given noise level, maximize the level at which the desired signal is received. As you may have already guessed, by avoiding wastage in lateral directions, by focusing your outward energy only in the direction where it is indeed useful by forming a sharp narrow focus to beam you can clearly see that beamforming improves the level of the desired signal at the receiver. Thereby, it improves the numerator of the ratio, and thereby it improves SNR. Improvement in SNR and thereby improvement in spectral efficiency, and thereby improvement in user speed or throughput is one of the fundamental benefits of beamforming. But that is not the end, there are a few more benefits, we are going to talk about, although this would be the most fundamental of the model.
### BENEFITES OF BEAMFORMING :
-As it says here beamforming can enable us to generate multiple narrow beams. What it means is that if your user is located here then your energy beam will be transmitted in this direction. On the other hand, if your user is located somewhere here, you're transmitted beam would be oriented in this direction. So a typical 5G gNodeB is capable of forming multiple beams. Now whether those multiple beams can be formed at the same time or whether the gNodeB can form those multiple beams only at different points in time. That is a valid question and the answer to that usually depends on implementation. And overall sophistication of the software and hardware that goes in Antananarivo as well as being forming. So it depends on implementation but in general be it simultaneously or at different points in time. gNodeB's do have the ability to form multiple beings in different directions. So that no matter where the user is different directions can be covered by outward be himself energy. Now, given that multiple beams can be transmitted stands to reason that we would want to have different types of beams, so to speak. The beams that are generally formed along the horizontal plane are a part of what is known as as or horizontal beam forming. And the beams that are along the vertical axis are called elevation, beforming or vertical beforming. So as a mutual beforming as you can see is useful to cover all the users that are located along the ground plate. Whereas elevation beforming will be beneficial in covering different users that are still located on different floors of the same building. And by putting as immutable and elevation beforming together. We can have a truly three dimensional coverage by means of these individual narrow beams. So this is how beforming can provide you 3D coverage. And that brings us to the second benefit of massive mind.

In that, as it says here, individual beams can serve different users. And that brings us back to what we mentioned over here, that depending upon the sophistication of the gNodeB. A certain gNodeB may be able to generate multiple beams at the same time. So if you are considering such a gNodeB that can form multiple beams at the same time. And you have another user over here, let's say this is user one and this would be your user two. Given that the gNodeB can form multiple beams at the same time, it can send one beam to user one. And at the same time it can use the antinori to form under the independent being that goes to user two at the same time. And because you are now able to serve both users one and two at the same time using different beams. You would have improved not just the individual throughput or data spirits of those users. But you would have improved the network capacity as well. And that in technical terms is called mu Mimo or multi user Mimo. Because you are able to serve multiple users in the same cell at the same time using different beams. That phenomenon is called mu Mimo and the throughput as well as the network capacity improvement brought on by a mu Mimo serves as the 2nd benefit of massive MIMO without beforming. Because without beforming, you cannot have mu Mimo. The benefit that is provided by improved snR versus reuse of the same frequency channel is independent additional benefits. And that is the beginning of the true power of beforming. In that it improves snR of wireless communication. Mu MIMO can greatly improve network capacity. And because different beams can use the same frequency channel. You can send more data within the same frequency spectrum for different users. Which significantly and additionally improves your spectral efficiency.

### > Beamsweeping :
Beamforming in that the narrow beams of energy are capable of going farther and providing better signal quality. The second clause is something we have already seen in the form of improved SNR.In that if you have energy focused in a narrow beam because your energy is focused in just one direction, that beam of energy will go farther. Now, the technical significance of this is related to cellular coverage. We saw during the previous module that every cell has a coverage and it depends on its frequency of operation and it is the boundary where the signal from that cell begins to attenuate. But that coverage definition is mostly given in terms of legacy technologies without beamforming. But if you use beam forming as a 5G Norby, you are going to focus your energy in a certain direction and that allows the beam of energy to travel further, thus extending the reach of your wireless signal and thereby improving your cellular coverage. And in the same essence, beam sweeping is used to transmit not specialized information that may be relevant just one or two users. But rather beam sweeping is used to transmit generic information that will be useful and applicable to all the users no matter where they are located in the cell. Going back a few modules we learned about control plane versus user plane. User plane obviously is user specific but some elements of control plane is are relevant for all the users in the 5G cell, no matter where they are. And beam sweeping is used to transmit those generic pieces of control information that achieve fundamentally a couple of things. It helps the begin communicating with the 5G network. And on the other hand it helps the gNodeB roughly figure out in what direction the UE is located whether the UE is located here or whether the UE is located there. So that the subsequently informing can be based on that decision. So this is the overall concept of beeamforming which ultimately relies on massive MIMO. And the antenna array. And this is how individual beams can be used to perform beamsweeping.

The concept of layerization in cellular networks in a typical ran or base station or in this specific case based band unit. It's not a homogeneous black box, but rather there are multiple layers of responsibility within BBU each layer has a unique functionalities and responsibilities. And one of those responsibilities is to make certain decisions and pursuant to that decision, go on the behavior of all the bottom layers. That is one common functionality of all the multiple layers that exist within a BBU. And in logical terms it is no different from a typical corporation
There is one headquarters where executives certain work. Then there are some more regional offices where in there are, let's say, upper management employees. Then middle management sits at a few more locations and add the bottom the staff and supervisors, they work at all the locations. So a typical corporation is like a pyramid. 
### RAN FUNCTIONAL SPLIT :
At this point, we have known that are typical base station has two portions, BBU and radio unit, or RRH. Based band unit is responsible, as the name suggests for basement processing and remote radio head would be responsible for RF or radio frequency processing. The concept of layerization in cellular networks in a typical ran or base station or in this specific case based band unit. It's not a homogeneous black box, but rather there are multiple layers of responsibility within BBU each layer has a unique functionalities and responsibilities. And one of those responsibilities is to make certain decisions and pursuant to that decision, go on the behavior of all the bottom layers. That is one common functionality of all the multiple layers that exist within a BBU. And in logical terms it is no different from a typical corporation. How is a typical corporation structure? There is one headquarters where executives certain work. Then there are some more regional offices where in there are, let's say, upper management employees. Then middle management sits at a few more locations and add the bottom the staff and supervisors, they work at all the locations. So a typical corporation is like a pyramid. And as you go down that pyramid, the number of locations at which its members are present that goes up. But not only that there is a fundamental difference between those layers in that some of the real time data today short term decisions are made at the location at staff or supervisor level. Whereas as you go up the chain of command, the nature of decisions to be made also changes. The decisions that executives or upper management's made are mostly related to long term strategic operation of the company rather than day to day short term operation of the company.

And if you have this corporation, a model in mind, you can look at the BBU in a similar manner. There are multiple layers of hierarchy within a BBU, lower layers are responsible for making short term real time decisions. Whereas upper layers are responsible more towards making long term strategic operational decisions. And just like your headquarters, executives or upper management don't need to be located at every single outlet of the company. Just like that some of the upper layers in the BBU don't have to be located at every single base station. Because they make long term strategic decisions that are applicable to not just one base station but could be applicable to multiple base stations. And that is where the layerization and functional split inside the RAN or BBU in specific comes into picture. In that the BBU in 5G can be logically divided into two components, one called centralized unit and the other called distributor unit. Centralist unit would be the equivalent of executives and upper management Inc responsible for making long term strategic decisions and hence they are located at select offices. Whereas distributed unit will be the equivalent of, let's say middle managers or staff and supervisors that are located at many more locations, preferably at every location. And they are mainly responsible for making real time, day to day operational decisions.

Given the relationship between the kind of decisions CU and DU make it is possible to split this BBU into two parts CU and DU. And once again going to the nature and urgency of their decisions DUs are present with nearly every radio unit. Whereas centralized units, as the name suggests are located only once every end number of DUs. So although there may be one to one correspondence between DU and radio units, there doesn't need to be one to one correspondence between CU and U. One CU can very comfortably handle multiple DUs just like one corporate headquarters is responsible for multiple regional offices. So this is how RAN functional split happens between CU and DU one CU corresponding to multiple DUs. And the reason that split is made is because our DUs are responsible for real time decisions. Whereas CUs are responsible for long term strategic decisions and hence they can be safely separated away. Furthermore you can have one CU handling multiple DUs and thereby giving you operational efficiencies. Not only that because you're CU can be located, it can also be deployed in a cloud, just like your some of your other network functions can, as we have seen before. And with cloud deployment come all the other benefits, such as scalability, flexibility and cost effectiveness. So this is what RAN functional split is, and these are some of the fundamental reasons why we even think about RAN functional split.

### Traditional RAN vs. Virtualized RAN (vRAN)
Although, 5G is in a position to fully utilize virtualized RAN, it is not necessary that every network operator will go with virtualized RAN. There are certain use cases where traditional RAN can work fine enough if not better. For example, if you just had to provide bearable coverage in this particular area as an example, an operator could just buy a traditional RAN base station that would have both the baseband unit as well as the radio unit in an instant. You would have a sufficient wireless coverage in this area, thanks to this new cell. But there are certain use cases where traditional RAN ends up being an overkill. For example, as we know, RAN has two components; baseband unit and radio unit. It is possible for some use cases that you will only need coverage-related capabilities of radio unit, but not processing capabilities that come with baseband unit. Whereas, if you buy the entire box, then you have essentially spent your money on buying a BBU that wasn't exactly beneficial to you. This is one scenario, along with many others, wherein traditional RAN could end up being an overkill for your system. Although, such a deployment might sound simpler. One of the foremost drawbacks of traditional RAN, as you may have guessed already, is higher capital and operational expenditure. How would a virtualized deployment look like on the other hand? Well, the individual base stations would mostly just be the radio units antenna, and the associated remote radio heads or RF processing units, and all those radio units would ultimately connect to a BBU. The point here is that, the virtualized deployment is more flexible as compared to traditional deployment because all you need is a radio unit, which is going to be substantially cheaper than deploying an entire base station. For example, on this radio unit, you need higher computational power, you can scale your Cloud resources here accordingly, and dedicate that capacity to this particular radio unit so that, that particular 5G cell now is in a position to give higher throughput and higher capacity exactly as your design warranted. Virtualized RAN can essentially achieve the same or even better results, but at lower cost, thereby, requiring operators to have lower startup investments. But not only that, because of the overall Cloud-friendly nature of virtualized RAN, these deployments are more scalable and flexible than what a traditional RAN would entail. The prime benefit of virtualized RAN is that, it is a surgical solution, it solves only those problems that are currently critical, and by avoiding wastage of capital on problems that aren't really problems, by taking the surgical approach, virtualized RAN utilizes operator capital more efficiently, thereby, still giving the improved performance in terms of latency and throughput that the RAN is required to offer.

## 6 MODULE: 5G PRIVATE NETWORKS AND INDUSTRIAL IOT

### What Are Private Networks and difference between public and private network ?

Private networks and industrial IoT.They are a dedicated networks that are designed and deployed for the use of a single enterprise for their specific operational requirements. This is in direct contrast to the networks that our phones happen to use every day, which in this spotlights are called public networks. There are certain key differences between private and public networks that are set private networks apart. There are many, but let's at least look at some of the important ones. The purpose of a public network is to provide a wide array of services to all the subscribers that may be present in that city. Usually those subscribers would be scattered all across the city in multiple blocks, in multiple tall buildings, etc. No matter where the subscribers are or what applications they're running, for example, it may be a Cloud gaming, a high-definition video streaming, or just regular voice and video calls. For all those purposes, you have in public domain a common network. On the other hand, a private network will prioritize specific services. The focus would be to provide those services to devices of a specific customer. Furthermore, those devices would mostly be congregated rather in a relatively small area. There are three threads to be looked at: specific services, a specific customer, and a specific area. All of these are in direct contrast with the mission of the public network which is to provide a common connectivity platform. That is what sets private networks apart because they are meant for a specific purpose, for a specific customer, and a specific area. We can leverage many other aspects of our network design and network deployment to our advantage in a private network. This is how.

A public network would require literally dozens of base station to cover the city, which it is expected to provide a service for. On the other hand, depending upon the area to be covered in the private network, it would require a very few base stations. As we have previously seen during our millimeter wave discussion towards the end of the module, we saw real-life examples of millimeter wave networks being designed and deployed. There was, for example, a factory floor at 5,000 square foot area that was covered satisfactorily with just three base stations. On the other hand, one can only guess and just how much area of a city, three base stations can cover. You are definitely going to need more base stations. That is one key difference between public and private networks in that because you have a small area to be covered, private networks only require very few base stations. Because public networks are required to cover a wider variety of topologies, the network design is largely influenced by extraneous factors such as buildings, roads, hills, etc. public networks mostly operate on licensed spectrum. Whereas because private networks operate in limited and somewhat isolated areas in certain cases, their spectrum doesn't have to be licensed. It can be shared or at the other end, it can also be unlicensed.

That is another benefit, that private networks have Inter-operability is an interesting point in that a public network subscriber cannot leverage service from a private network. Whereas a subscriber of a private network, depending upon the agreements between the private network provider and the public network provider, may be able to leverage service from not only the private network, but also from the public network so that inter-operability is another point to be kept in mind regarding private network. One simpler way to understand that is your home Wi-Fi. Only you know the password for your home Wi-Fi connection. Only you can access that network, but an open network, let's say an airport or a cafe, pretty much anybody can access that network because it is an open network. You can access both the networks, but somebody who can ask someone else who can access the cafe network can't necessarily access your home network because, in that sense, it is your private Wi-Fi network.

### > Benefits of Private Networks
First of all, the design and deployment of a private network can be controlled to a great extent by the network designer or the ultimate customer, is the private network owner. Because you have great control, what network design and deployment, what it means is that you can carefully optimize your wireless coverage where it is needed, what it is, where it is not that important. You no longer have to cover an entire city in a blanket data manner. If for example, we have a private network and you don't need a coverage in a basement, you can very well design and optimize your coverage only to provide wireless coverage on the main floor and not the basement. This is the control I'm referring to. Once you design your private network, precisely meet your requirements, you can virtually guarantee a certain quality of service or QoS, and that entails guaranteed performance with respect to metrics such as two-port latency, etc.

Not only that, because a private network is your own network, it offers you a higher degree of service reliability, and availability. All of us have been in a situation where we did try to make a call and the network wasn't available or we tried to browse a page and the network who did not respond. But that was an artifact of the network being a public network because there were a hundreds or even thousands of other users in the same vicinity trying to compete for the same resources. The reliability and availability of the public wireless network naturally came down. Whereas because the private network is carefully designed for a limited number of users, you can virtually guarantee a high degree of service reliability and availability. Furthermore, because it is your private network, you can have what is known as on-premise deployment, just like your Wi-Fi router and the ISP modem associated with that resides in your own home. The setup to a large extent of a private cellular network can also reside on the premises of the private network owner. Once you have all the equipment on your premises, you can have great operational control as well as service flexibility. If you want to, for example, add more capability or switch capabilities or swap capabilities, which will include different resources. You can do that because everything is under your control. It is on your premises as a private network owner. Furthermore, if you have an on-premise deployment, you can also scale and improve that deployment precisely depending upon the needs of your applications.

### Industrial IoT (I-IoT) and 5G
Some of you may have heard of an acronym called IoT or Internet of things.some of the machines started to get electric and that led us into the second generation of industry with electrification in the early 20th century. With the advent of semiconductors and the subsequent digitization, we enter the third era of industrialization which was centered on digitization. In that more and more industrial machines and gadgets either became fully digitized or started to have some digital components to them. However, although different gadgets in an industry were digitized, it is not necessary that they communicated with each other in that. To a large extent they worked as independent of each other in different silos. They might have communicated with their individual controllers or maybe to a database but that was essentially it. And that changes in the fourth generation of industrialization known as Industry 4.0 whose cornerstone is connectivity. All the devices that were so far digitized but wouldn't necessarily communicate with each other they will now communicate with a network while doing so. They will upload their operational data, so to speak onto the server. The network server will aggregate such operational data from dozens or hundreds or even thousands or millions of such devices. It will look at that aggregated data, translate that into certain concrete operational insight. And then download that operational insight onto those individual devices which can be used by those devices in order to improve and further optimize their own operation. So this is the premise of The 4th Generation of industry that is enabled by connectivity and that fourth generation is called industrial IoT or industrial internet of things, sometimes also known as IoT. And given that connectivity is a cornerstone of industry 4.0 or IoT stands to reason that 5G is a prime candidate to fulfill that connectivity requirement. And with high speed, low latency, reliable and secure communication, one can only surmise just how far 5G is going to take industry 4.0.

So let's take a detailed look at some of the possible industrial IoT use cases that 5G may be able to facilitate and they span a wide gamut as much as an industrial IoT can do by itself. In that imagine a container report, you have a lot of reflective metallic surfaces but not only that there is constant motion, hardly anything at a container ports is sitting study. And as we have seen 5G is capable of operating under such challenging conditions in which there is not just mobility but a lot of reflections. Imagine an oil refinery on the other hand where there would be thousands of sensors transmitting real time data and looking for feedback from the central controller. The massive IoT portion of 5G is well equipped to satisfy such a use case. It might be as simple as a sensor or a handheld terminal by a factory operator or it might be as complex and demanding as virtual reality headsets for training or operations in risky environments. And robotic arms that require instructions at a millisecond level. There are other verticals such as construction and mining where things are changing on a daily basis, but yet safety is of paramount importance. And those are the use cases where service class such as URLLC with its millisecond level delay and extremely high reliability. Can provide the requisite amount of safety, no matter what conditions you're operating in, warehouses are a different beast altogether. As you typically know, warehouses are full of tall shelves, floor to ceiling shelves that are just stacked full of goods that need to be stored or transported. And there is only a narrow alleyway between two shelves that are adjacent to each other. And industrial robots or people nonetheless need to venture into those narrow alleyways in order to deposit or retrieve a specific box. And that requires that despite such challenging RF conditions, the wireless signal should be able to not just reach this robot or this forklift for example. But it should be able to reach with significant reliability as well as low latency and high throughput, all of which as we know, 5G is in a position to provide another potential use case could be wind farms. Imagine how wind farms look. They are generally located on flatlines, multiple square miles in area and subsequent wind farms are located quite far from each other for safety and efficiency purposes. And that at least to me quickly reminds of a particular use case. We saw earlier when we were talking about millimeter wave are deploying large or long distance connections in rural areas. This is a prime use case of that principle we had earlier discussed, imagine a wind farm that spans several square miles on the relatively flat line.

If you could just deploy a tall millimeter wave base station towards the center of that area, you could have wireless broadband connectivity for several miles on end, not just to provide for latency and throughput, but also for specific levels of security that enterprises might require. So these are some of the wide variety of use cases where 5G will be applicable in the industrial IoT ecosystem.

### Private Networks for I-IoT
the private network will be able to meet multiple use cases. It could be just hundreds or even thousands of sensors or some of them may be mobile robotic vehicles, also known as AGV or automated guided vehicles. Some of them may be just our personal devices such as phones, tablets or devices used by persons such as a laptop computer or handheld monitoring terminal. And at the other end there could be some delivery trucks, for example that ferry back and forth between your industrial plants and those of your customers or your vendors. Whatever devices are going to be pretty much enclosed, be it stationary or mobile. But whichever devices are pretty much going to be enclosed within the confines of your industrial plant will only connect to the private network. Whereas truly mobile vehicles such as delivery trucks that are going to not just leave your plant but probably also going to go to a different city state etc. Will have the ability to communicate with not just your private network, but optionally also with a macro public network. Leveraging the interoperability clause of public networks and private networks that we had earlier talked about. So when this delivery truck is dogged in the industrial plant, it will no doubt utilize the private network. But once it leaves the industrial plant and it is on the streets or freeways, it can still use service from a 5G public network. So this is how at least in a simple schematic level 5G private networks and IIoT fit together in order to support a variety of use cases that we saw earlier. And just to reiterate some of the benefits or unique advantages of 5G. Private networks for IIoT would be that because your design is tailored for your specific scenarios, the design would be fully optimized with respect to multiple metrics such as quality of service throughput and latency. Your private network deployment would be dedicated for your specific industrial plants. And at such it would be easier to deploy and easy to independently manage for you as the factory owner. Not just that you can leverage another dimension of security, we are going to talk about it later. But in addition to the basic security that 5G air interface and networks provide because you can have as many components as possible in the overall service network on your own premises. You can also ensure physical security of the data. So by keeping some of the sensitive data local, you can ensure the security of that data precisely to the extent that you want to. And because 5G private networks on account of their wireless broadband performance assurance will provide wire like gigabit or multi gigabit, reliable performance. With flexibility and mobility of a wireless environment. 5G private networks are set to be able to achieve the best of both worlds in that wire like optical fiber-like speeds. But at the same time, flexibility and mobility of a truly wireless environment. So this is How 5G private networks and IIoT fit together very nicely in a simple schematic. Which can always be extended for complex use cases and these are some of their operational advantages.
### Industrial IoT vs Massive IoT :
Now, with basic understanding of industrial IoT in mind, a question might have popped up in some of your minds. That is, is industrial IoT just about IoT or massive IoT in 5G parlance or is it something beyond that? As it turns out, industrial IoT is much more than just massive IoT. Remember, some of the 5G service classes, we had learned about earlier such as massive IoT, enhanced mobile broadband, and ultra-reliable low latency communication or URLLC. Well, there are certain paradigms or use cases in industrial IoT that lie squarely within the realm of massive IoT, but more interestingly, there are many other use cases and applications that are actually under confluence of two or more of the service classes that 5G offers. What do I mean by that? Well, let's look at an example of the first category wherein consider industrial sensors. A typical industrial plant might look like what you see in the background here. It is just full of metallic reflective machinery, floor to ceiling, wall to wall. Some of the components might not be stationary either. They might be moving as a function of time. What kind of use cases we can see in a typical industry such as this? Well, there may be hundreds or even thousands of sensors. Some of those sensors will be located in challenging coverage conditions, but would still be expected to function as if everything is fine. Furthermore, many of those sensors will be battery operated and they will be expected to survive on the same battery supply for days, weeks, or even months on it, if not more. That use case, as you can see that of sensors, is squarely under the realm of massive IoT. But what about certain other use cases? Imagine security cameras, for example. We know that our security cameras continuously feed high-definition video feed back to the controller. It is definitely an eMBB use case. No doubt about that. But keep in mind at the same time, some of those security cameras might be located in challenging coverage conditions. For example, at the end of a narrow hallway or on the outer periphery of your industrial park. Places wherein your wireless network coverage may not be as strong as it may be inside your factory or towards the center of your factory.

As such, even though they have eMBB like properties, those cameras may be expected to be able to operate under challenging coverage conditions. That puts the use case squarely at the intersection of massive IoT and eMBB. There is another use case of automated guided vehicles or AGV. These are essentially autonomous robots that can largely function on their own. But in order to go from one point to another intermittently, they might need some human interaction in the form of commands, requests, and responses. some of these AGVs will require millisecond-level latency because a few milliseconds of delay in conveying the correct information to the automated guided vehicle can be the difference between that AGV turning into the right aisle of the industry or the warehouse versus it turning into the wrong aisle and that could be the difference between efficient operation versus inefficient operation. AGVs are going to require millisecond-level latencies which put them squarely under the realm of URLLC. But at the same time keep in mind that the wireless conditions are going from the private gNodeB to your AGV may not always be ideal. the AGV might be in a narrow lane between two tall shelves that are floor to ceiling stacked with different boxes. At such, the wireless channel quality for that AGV, at least at that instance, is going to be very poor. In such conditions, the AGV, nonetheless, is going to be required to have the ability to provide such millisecond-level accuracy while operating in challenging coverage conditions. That is what puts this particular use case at the confluence of massive IoT and URLLC. You can make similar arguments about many different use cases we have seen earlier. At the end of the day what you'll realize is that very few use cases in industrial IoT are cut and dry in that they fall squarely under one or the other service class. A majority of the interesting use cases in industrial IoT are rather under confluence of two or even more of the service classes that 5G offers, such as eMBB, massive IoT, and URLLC. Now that we have gone one more step further into looking at how 5G private networks will interplay with industrial IoT.

### Private Networks Deployment Considerations
When a factory owner decides to deploy their own private network. What are some of the factors that they have to keep in mind when they get closer to deployment? Well, there are many, but some of the key factors are listed over here. Some of them may be region specific, but beyond that, there are certain broader principles that applied on the list. As always, we'll start with the spectrum because spectrum is the most fundamental resource requirement of any wireless network, public or private. What kind of spectrum you as a private network operator are going to work with? That is a fundamental decision you need to make. And because that decision is so important, we have more elaboration coming on it shortly. But what are some of the other decisions that are private network operators might need to make? Well, there may be decisions such as network architecture, whether you go with 5G standalone or 5G non standalone network. If the industrial operator already has some form of a private 4G network, for example, then that operator might go with an NSA deployment. On the other hand, if that factory operator does not have any prior private network, that operator might as well go with 5G standalone network. Furthermore, regardless of SA or NSA, where do you keep your core network? Whether you keep it on premise or whether you keep it somewhere in the cloud. Or whether you keep it on the premises of a cellular network operator in the public domain. As always, given these multiple decision points, there are tradeoffs at every point in that a local deployment. As we have seen earlier, would be beneficial in terms of performance and security, but it will also cost somewhat more. On the other hand, a cloud based deployment of the core network is probably going to be the cheapest. But performance in terms of latency or throughput may not always be guaranteed by default. If you have to guarantee performance in such a paradigm, you as a private network operator has to take certain other steps. So these are some of the considerations regarding core network architecture, RAN also has its own considerations.

For example, whether you decide to go with traditional RAN or whether you decide to go with virtualized RAN in either option. Whether you go for an established vendor or whether owing to the software, hardware and control data in separation that we have learned about earlier. Going to that, whether you choose to diversify your vendor base. You pick software from one vendor and hardware from another vendor and make sure that they are compatible. Even if you go with virtualized ran, whether you go with an integrated baseband unit. Or whether you choose to separate the two in a CU or a DU as we have learned about in the virtualized ran section. Those are some of the fundamental decisions that private network operators will have to make regarding RUN before the deploy such a private network. And in addition to this, there are, as I mentioned, many other dimensions of a private network deployment that operators have to contend with. It is not necessary that the industrial owner has to get everything from just one vendor. The industrial operator probably can do some of the things by itself. Whereas it can outsource some of the other things to one or multiple vendors. There is a wider variety of situations in which these private networks could be deployed. And given that spectrum is of paramount importance. Let's take a quick look at some of the spectrum related considerations in private networks.

### Spectrum Options for Private Networks & I-IoT
Pursuant to that, there are multiple options that private network owners can choose when deploying 5G private network for IOT purposes. At one end they can use licensed spectrum, but that spectrum may be owned by a different cellular network operator which may be in the public domain. So the industrial owner can either by the spectrum from that operator a small sliver of the spectrum or it can lease the spectrum long term or it can just ask for short term allocations of that licensed or dedicated spectrum. And because it is a dedicated spectrum as we saw earlier, all the benefits with respect to performance guarantee can be attained although at a slightly higher cost. There is a different type of licensed spectrum that is introduced specifically for IOT networks, and that is called the dedicated spectrum. In that in several countries, certain slivers of frequency spectrums have started to be dedicated for industrial purposes. And industrial factory owners by their own volition can participate in auction for those particular frequency channels rather than them being limited to traditional cellular network operators. So even this is licensed or dedicated spectrum, but with key differences in that it is in a slightly different range. For example, in Germany, it is in 3.7 gigahertz. That spectrum maybe in a slightly different range as compared to our traditional cellular networks. And secondly the factory owner doesn't have to lease or ask for a spectrum from a traditional cellular network operator anymore, a factory owner can also try to buy some of the dedicated spectrum. And furthermore that spectrum doesn't have to be owned by one single factory owner as we saw earlier, there is a shared spectrum model. In that multiple factory owners can jointly, buy a certain piece of spectrum and they can use that spectrum in either different geographical regions or in slightly different frequencies of the same band or at different times of the day, for example. And more complex arrangements can also be chalked out. Then at the other end of the rainbow, we had unlicensed spectrum which will continue to have. As you know, it is free so the industrial factory owner doesn't have to shell out any money to buy this spectrum. But because many other players may also be using the same unlicensed spectrum stands tourism, that performance cannot be guaranteed in such a private network deployment built on top of some unlicensed spectrum. That is okay if your fundamental use cases are mostly mMBB or IOT related, massive IOT related, I should say.

However, if URLLC a time sensitive performance is going to be your requirement, but you still don't have the budget to buy licensed or dedicated spectrum, some of the further releases or generations of 5G are working on certain mechanisms that would allow two or more factory owners to use unlicensed spectrum in a synchronized shared manner. For example, they can chalk out an agreement either dynamic or a static agreement, so that both the networks know when exactly they are and are not allowed to use the unlicensed spectrum in their respective private networks. And although the underlying spectrum is unlicensed, some of the advanced mechanisms that are coming up in future releases of 5G will allow those players to use that unlicensed spectrum in a synchronized shared manner. And that is expected to allow operation of even time sensitive use cases such as URLLC. And in continuation of other theme of discussing some of the practical considerations of the theoretical concepts we have learned so far, let's try to put all these concepts together. And let's try to see how an industrial network might look like when it transitions from the current legacy technologies to an upcoming technology such as 5G. So on the left you have a Legacy Network, you have multiple pieces of industrial machinery, you have input and output devices, such as utility meters etcetera. And you have other myriad industrial devices, such as robots or handheld terminals and your other mechanical components. At the other side of the network, you have all the industrial controllers, you have databases, you've servers etcetera. And currently all this framework communicates with each other using legacy ethernet networks in most cases. As you know, ethernet gives you good enough performance, but the fundamental disadvantage of ethernet is that, because it is tethered to a wire ethernet clearly discourages mobility. Whereas in reality, in modern industries, much of the equipment is not stationary, it is mobile.

For example, robotic equipment, automatic guided vehicles, augmented or virtual reality, headsets, handheld terminals, all these devices will greatly benefit from mobility. And that is what tells us we have to move away from this legacy paradigm of ethernet which is static and rigid into a modern paradigm such as 5G. And that is where similar considerations as we had earlier discussed during NSA versus SA deployments of 5G networks come into picture, although in a slightly different context. In that ideally you would not only want to replace this ethernet network which is rigid and inflexible with 5G wireless networks, but you will also want all these devices to have native connectivity to 5G. That is you would want them to have 5G antennas and then being able to exchange 5G wireless signals with the 5G wireless network. Although that is a utopian idealistic scenario we would want to get to in the near future. That cannot however, be accomplished immediately. Because upgrading all these devices would be a significant challenge not just that, it would require a lot of budget and careful planning on the part of the industrial owner. So is there a stepping stone in between? Yes, there indeed is. And that is shown in this figure which has not just a self sufficient 5G network including the rung and the core network over here, but on both the interfaces it is mediated by an adapter. That adapter is called 5G to ethernet adapter or y salsa.

The basic job of this adapter is to convert 5G signals into ethernet in this direction and ethernet signals into 5G in this direction. And because this adapter works transparently in the middle, what will happen is that these legacy devices will continue to send and receive ethernet messages, but instead of communicating with an ethernet network they will be communicating with the adapter. On the other hand, 5G devices or 5G network will continue to send 5G signals but those signals will be received not by these individual devices but rather by these adapters. And those adapters will convert 5G signals into ethernet in this direction and in upward direction they will convert ethernet signals into 5G signals. So this is one example of how the ethernet can be replaced with 5G wireless network in a manner that is completely transparent to all the legacy devices. Because keeping my legacy devices still keep talking in ethernet protocol thinking that there is an ethernet device on the other end. But the adapter converts those ethernet messages into 5G signals, so to speak. And the 5G network on the other hand thinks that it is communicating with 5G devices rather than legacy devices. So this is one example the way in which 5G systems can replace the jungle of ethernet cables and switches and other components in a manner that is transparent to the legacy devices and machines. And that allows us to offer all the benefits of private 5G networks in an IIOT like paradigm to be leveraged with backward compatibility.

## 5G SECURITY :-
### > Overview of Security in 5G
First, we will take a high-level look at how the 5G security framework looks like given that it is going to support different devices use cases, and not just that, it is importantly going to support different deployments. For example, one network might have on-premise score network, whereas other operator might have a core network situated in the Cloud. Some operator might have traditional run, another operator might have virtualized run. Given that there are multiple deployment options, how do you design a security framework that applies pretty much regardless of the specific deployment option that a specific operator might choose? That is something we will take just a high-level look at the beginning. Then we will look at what are some of the security-related offerings of 5G. We won't look at exact mechanisms and algorithms, but we'll see what 5G does; generally enhance security, not just of data storage, but that of data transmission as well. That would lead us into the discussion of integrity protection, encryption, as well as offering security across network boundaries. Then we'll turn our attention to some of the privacy-related announcements that 5G makes. Now, as we know, our phones are transmitting a lot of data to the network these days, but how does 5G ensure that some of the core 5G-related data that can potentially identify a certain subscriber by name and address, for example, how is that data protected? That is something we will take a look at the end of this module.

### > Enhanced System-Level Design
That is 3GPP access and non 3GPP access, now, the broader meaning of those terms is somewhat beyond our scope right now, but this is what they mean at a very high simplistic level. 3GDP access essentially to the 5G core network Is when a user is trying to access 5G core network over either a 5G public network or a 5G private network, but at the end of the day It is a 5G Rand. So a user trying to access 5G core network Over 5G ran that will be turned In this context. 3GDP access and that is the use case that an overwhelming majority of 5G devices will be asking for However, there is another use case that is non 3GB access. Non 3GDP in this context means a different air interface or wireless technology than 5G such as Wifi. For example, in that the headline is Some users, if not all, may request connectivity to 5G core network while they are connected to a wifi hotspot rather than a 5G will be. Now, before we understand the intricacies, let's first understand why such a use case would arise. Imagine that a certain network operator has deployed a macro cell network in a certain part of the city, but let's say that maybe there is going to be a pop up concert at a certain place or maybe there is a celebrity going to sign the book at a mall. And there is going to be some temporary crowd and that location for which the operator might need extra capacity and extra throughput. Keep in mind that deploying of 5G at such locations for temporary purposes may not be very economically viable. So under such a representative conditions, what the operator might choose to do is the following. Instead of deploying a five G base station, just have a wifi hotspot at that point. And instead of the Wifi hotspot connecting to a third party ISPS network, that hotspot in the end will be connecting to that cellular network operators or 5G core network. So all the users in that particular area, such as the shopping mall, the users particularly of that cellular network operator, the subscribers of that operator will also be able to connect to this Wifi hotspot using the Wifi connection on their 4, not 5G but Wifi connection. But in the end, that connection will go back to a five G core network, thus allowing those subscribers to be able to access all the features of a typical 5G core network over a Wifi access channel rather than a 5G air interface. So that is a quick high level background on non 3GPP access and just one of the representative use cases that it might be deployed under. So given that there could be multiple use cases of deployment, as given over here, how does 5G ensure authentication and security etc? Well the good news is regardless of what their interface the subscriber will be using to access score network, 5G institutes, one common authentication framework for all their interfaces. So no matter how a subscriber connects to the 5G core network, it will have gone through at least a minimum degree of common authentication regardless of its connecting area.

So that is a little bit about this unified authentication framework. There is a slight difference in 5G security architecture at least at a high level as compared to legacy technologies in that commonality. First of all, he is most of the security related mechanisms like encryption authentication are hosted within the core network. But in addition there is a slight change to this framework, for one simple reason. We have seen the concept of mobile edge computing where in certain high priority application servers may be located with your core network or even better with your access network such as you are a wealthy services or other real time services. Now if your application server was located here, but your security mechanisms were located in the core network. Then essentially the security mechanisms are the time that it takes to execute those security mechanisms are likely going to be the bottleneck for the whole service. And even though you had your application server located with the access network, it wouldn't exactly provide you the latency benefit that you were hoping at least in most cases. because every subscriber has to ultimately paying the core network for security and other authentication as well as encryption related mechanisms. That problem to certain extent, is alleviated by this new component called security anchor function. At a high level it's basic responsibility is to offload some of the security related responsibilities from the core network and bring those responsibilities towards the edge of the access network. So just like H computing brings an application server from far away near the access network, security anchor function brings some of the security functionalities from the core network closer to the end user in the realm of access network. Now, to what extent operators may deploy that and what are the exact functionalities that the anchor function will accomplish? That remains to be seen in implementation, but 5G framework nonetheless is flexible enough to allow for replicating the edge computing like scenario for security purposes as well. And above everything our security, our level can be adjusted dynamically in the network depending upon the exact needs of the application as well as their scalability. For example, stands to reason that you are LLC or mission critical like application is obviously going to require much tighter security controls as compared to a regular cloud gaming or video streaming application. And 5G Security framework is designed in a manner so as to be versatile in order to accomplish all those objectives by design.

### > Expanded Protection and Increased Flexibility
With that basic understanding about at the high level design of 5G security framework in mind, let's look at some of the specific ways in which 5G are not only increases data security, but also offers enhanced user privacy. The first aspect of increased level of security is that of integrator security credentials. Now, most of you know that the way security is provided or at least configured in our everyday phones, is by means of a SIM card. When you subscribe to a cellular network operators service, it provides you with a SIM card and some of the authentication and other credentials are stored on that SIM card to a certain extent. Now, your phone is always in your control. But imagine some of the industrial IoT devices, such as security cameras or robotic manufacturing arms. Some of those devices might be unmanned and they might go unmonitored for several hours at a stretch. How do we make sure that somebody just doesn't unplug the SIM card out of those devices, thereby jeopardizing the security of those devices? Well, an upcoming option in 5G paradigm is that of integrated security. In that, just like the software of that device will be integrated with the device, with the device hardware, the security keys such as encryption, authentication, and any other keys as maybe necessary. Some of those credentials will also be integrated with the device itself. Because the security parameters are closely tied to the device itself, it will be much more difficult for anybody to compromise the security of that particular device, at least more difficult than it would be to just take the SIM card out of such a device. Another aspect of 5G security is that of deeper key hierarchy. Although it might sound technical, let me help you understand that in very simple language. In a typical cellular network, there are two types of connectivity that a user can leverage when the user is in the coverage provided by its native cellular operator. It is set to be in the home network.

Whereas when the user moves to a different town or a state, or maybe even a different country where the subscribed cellular network operator does not or cannot provide coverage, that network operator partners with certain other network operators locally in order to provide roaming coverage. Given that mobility is an integral part of 5G networks, how can this framework ensure that security is provided not just in the home network, but in the roaming network as well. That is the fundamental premise of deeper key hierarchy. At a high level what it means is that no matter where the user is located, home network or a different rooming network, some of the fundamental security mechanisms, including your security keys, etc, will always be hosted in the home network. In a simple language, no matter where the user is, the user will always have an end-to-end secure data tunnel, so to speak, with its home network and thereby ensuring that no matter where the user is, it's security is not compromised because it follows the same grid as a security in the home network because there is this secure virtual data tunnel going from the home network to the user no matter where he is located. The final aspect is that of improved protection to both data plane as well as control plane. I hope we all remember what data plane versus control plane are. Legacy technologies such as LT, did have the mechanism of integrity protection, wherein you add a certain metadata with your data of interest so that if an attacker in the middle got access to the data, and maliciously changed are some of the data to a different set of bits and bytes, the ultimate receiver, using the metadata, would still be able to tell whether somebody tampered with the data in transit or whether that data came in without being tampered. That is the basic premise of integrity protection. Legacy technologies like LT limited that integrity protection only to control plane. But 5G has now expanded our integrity protection to user plane as well. That even not just the signaling but even user plane data, if it is tampered with by an attacker in the middle, such as your picture or your email, your 5G phone will be able to tell that that data was tampered with and as such to discard that data if it is observed to have been tampered with, and it will ask the network for a different copy of the same data.

### > Protecting User Privacy
It's called IMSI. Different generations have different versions of that identity. But it is, no matter what generation, there will be some Identity which would be generically called subscriber permanent identifier. That would be associated with you for the lifetime of your subscription. If you happen to be subscribed for the same service for years on end, with the same SIM card. Your IMSI may never change. Your subscriber identity is truly permanent in that regard. Because that subscriber identity can potentially be maliciously used to identify the personality of a certain user. It is paramount that all cellular on networks, including 5G, make their best effort in order to protect that subscriber permanent identity and 5G has multiple mechanisms to do that. First of all, 5G minimizes or if possible, altogether eliminates the occasions where your permanent identifier need to be shared with the network. Even so, some of the variance of that permanent identifier. If at all, they need to be shared. That information which can in any way be used to identify a certain user. That information, if at all it needs to be shared. Will only be shared with them network after encryption context has been established between the user and the network end-to-end. Until encryption context is established, the network will not ask the user to share any sort of sensitive information that can potentially be used to identify that user, not just its permanent identifying. However, there is certain other kind of information that is not user sensitive.

For example, how the network routes your data packets to you. That information doesn't need to be protected as much. Hence, such kind of generic information can be sent even without encryption being enabled so as not to add a system complexity. But any information that can be in any way used to track or identify individual users. That information either will not be shared with the network at all to minimize it's compromising occasions. Or if at all a variant of that information needs to be shared. It will be shared only after end-to-end encryption with the network has been enabled. Furthermore, a 5G network enhances user privacy by minimizing the use of this permanent identifier for user operation and rather using multiple temporary identifiers. Once the UE has connected to the network and has been authenticated by the network. In general, your phone can be in two states active or idle when you are actively transmitting or receiving some data on your phone, it is an active mode. Whereas when your phone is lying on your desk or your nightstand not doing anything, in those conditions, your phone is set to be in idle mode. In both of those modes, network assigns one or more temporary identifiers to your authenticated phone so that the network doesn't need to refer to its permanent identifier.
Furthermore, these temporary identifiers are recycled periodically. In that even if the network assigns a certain temporary ID to your phone it is valid only for a matter of few minutes or a few hours, beyond which it is recycled and discarded. That even if an attacker, by some means gets hold of temporary ID of certain user, the attacker cannot continue tracking that user maliciously indefinitely. But because that temporary ID will be recycled after a certain amount of time. That kind of attack will be taunted by definition and that point in time and thereby it prevents any unnecessary user tracking by malicious entities. Using temporary identifiers for UEs post authentication operation is another prominent way that the network ensures user privacy. But at this point, a question might have popped in your mind. That, hey, you mention that all the important business happens after authentication and encryption context has been established. But how does the network establish authentication or encryption context, or the security context. In general, with the UE without knowing what that UE is. Isn't that kind of a catch-22 wherein you are looking to establish security framework, but you haven't yet verified who that UE is. How do we solve that Catch-22. To speak.
5G operates its security mechanisms in a bootstrap manner in that, when the UE tries to connect to a 5G network. The UE doesn't send all their personal information in one go. It sends a little bit of information to the network information that is actually nonsensitive generic in nature. Using that information, the network establishes the first phase of the security. Based on that, UE sends the second batch of information. Based on that, the network establishes second stage of security. In this step-by-step bootstrap manner by establishing incremental authentication and security in multiple steps.
