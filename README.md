hey there ! this my understanding of 5G NR technology.
### WIRELESS COMMUNICATION: 
Wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium.
wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space.
*a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components*;**A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.**
+ **TRANSMITTER**- The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter.
+ **RECEIVER** - The entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver.
- our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals.
+ **WIRELESS SIGNALS-**  Wireless signals are also called Radio-frequency signals.
- All wireless or radio signals are quite similar in nature to sunlight or visible light, at such all wireless signals travel at the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second.
- Two basic attributes of radio frequency signals --->  frequency and wavelength
+ _Frequency :_ Frequency is the number of repetitions that the periodic electromagnetic signal undergoes in a given second, and the frequency is measured in the unit of hertz. 
+ _WAVELENGTH :_ Wavelength is the distance that periodic wireless signal travels during one cycle or one periodicity, and because it is a measure of distance, it is mostly measured in meters or millimeters.
+  wireless signals are interchangeably also called radio signals or radio frequency or RF signals because the frequency of those wireless signals happens to lie between the range specified by the traditional radio frequency range.
+ _HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE OVER A NETWORK :_
+  These periodic RF signals or wireless signals are also known as **carrier waves** because they carry the information from one end to the other.
+   RF signals are used as the so-called vehicle for information transfer because they carry your information from the transmitter to the receiver.
+  **Modulation** - is a process by which we impress or impose information onto the carrier wave for transmission.
+  Modulation at the high level is about carefully changing some of the specific attributes of the radio-frequency signal.
+  At the receiver, however, the other end of wireless communication, we need to extract that information from the incoming carrier wave.
+ **DEMODULATION :** Demodulation is the process of recovering the data that has been impressed upon the carrier wave by the transmitter.
+ *MODEM* stands for modulation and demodulation and is the device used for the same .

**WIRELESS CHANNEL-** The imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel.
- Radio frequency signal travels over the air and when it travels over the air it faces certain **impediments**. The most important and most significant of which is called attenuation or part loss or **transmission loss**.
- **Transmission loss**- The wireless signal has to spend some energy when going from one point to another.The manifestation of that loss of energy is quantified in technical terms as part loss or transmission loss.
- SIGNAL FROM OUR PHONE ----> CELL TOWER -----> RECEIVER'S PHONE
- The transmission loss or path loss is a roughly proportional operational frequency.
- Higher the frequency of operation, higher the corresponding path loss will be.
- IN SIMPLE WORDS -_Higher the frequency of the radio signal higher the pathloss that it encounters when going from one point to another._
- **Impediments that affect a wireless signal** -noise and interference
- **NOISE -** Noise is unwanted energy that is not deliberate in nature.
- In that the wireless noise or the electromagnetic noise is always present in most devices and most communication links. In fact, some of the noise can be one generated within the communication device itself, also known as **thermal noise**.
- The ambient noise which is always present and cannot be minimized beneath a certain threshold .
- **INTERFERENCE -** when two nearby transmitters and nearby is the key, when they use the same radio frequency at the same time, they create interference.
- Interference is deliberate in nature and can be mitigated by careful planning of the frequency use by different entities in the network.
- Noise and Interference have a tendency to **Change some of the fundamental attributes** of the electromagnetic carrier wave so that it becomes little difficult for the intended receiver to demodulate and extract the intended information from the signal that has slightly been changed in form because of noise and interference.

- SNR - SIGNAL NOISE RATIO gives us an mathematical estimation of the noise present .
- SINR - SIGNAL INTERFERENCE NOICE RATIO gives us an mathematical estimation of interference as well as noise present .
- 

- Noise and interference have a tendency to reduce the quality of the signal that is ultimately received .
